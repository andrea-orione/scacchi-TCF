The following things can be changed:
1. The type of characters used for displaying the chess board. 
   If the terminal used doesn't support the  ASCII  characters 
   used by default, it is possible to disable this feature.
   
   If you can correctly see â™• (black queen), there is no  need 
   to proceed.  If  your terminal doesn't properly display the 
   queen, type: 'simplified'.

   To revert to the default characters, type: 'no simplified'.
