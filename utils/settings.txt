The following features can be modified:
1. The type of characters used for displaying the chess board. 
   If the terminal used doesn't support the  ASCII  characters 
   used by default, it is possible to disable this feature.
   
   If you can correctly see â™• (black queen), there is no  need 
   to proceed.  If  your terminal doesn't properly display the 
   queen, type: 'simplified' and press Enter.

   To revert to the default characters, type:  'no simplified'
   and press Enter.

2. The style of the  board.  In particular,  it is possible to 
   print the board using colors (if the terminal used supports
   this feature). 
   To enable colors,  just type 'colored' and press Enter.  To 
   revert t the original settings, type 'no colored' and press
   Enter. 

Type 'exit' or press Enter to go back to the game.
