The board and the pieces support various representation:
1. `normal`: The  standard  display formatting. It uses  ASCII
   characters for displaying the board and the pieces.
   The background is all black. It is thought for dark themes,
   so make sure to set it if you want to use this formatting.
   To check if  your terminal supports this mode,  here â™•  you
   should see the black queen.
2. `simplified`: This  formatting is thought for old terminals
   that do not support ASCII characters. It uses only letters,
   dashes (-), underscores (_) and pipes (|).
3. `colored`: This  formatting  uses ANSI strings to  set  the
   background color of some characters to show the board whith
   colored squares. To use this mode, make  sure your terminal
   is able to process ANSI strings.
4. `inverted`: This formatting is thought  for terminals whith
   a light theme  enabled. It uses  the same principles as the
   normal theme, but  the color of the pieces  is inverted, to
   accomodate the background of the terminal.
Type the name of one of the modes and press Enter to use it. 
Type 'exit' or press Enter to go back to the game.
