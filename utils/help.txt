Provided that the user is familiar with the rules of chess, the
following   is   a  guide     on   how  to    play “CHESS-TCF”.

INTRODUCTION
------------
The program will display a board divided into 64 chess squares,
each  one  identified by a pair of values: the first indicating
the column with a letter from   'a'  to  'h', while  the second
indicating  the row with a  number from 1 to 8   (e.g., a1, c4,
f8,...). 
The chess  pieces are shown as their respective ASCII character.
If  the  terminal  used  doesn't support  this  feature, it  is 
instead shown:
- p for the pawns;
- r for the rooks;
- n for the knights;
- b for the bishops;
- q for the queens;
- k for the kings;
with uppercase letters for white  pieces and  lowercase letters 
for the black ones.


MOVES
-----
To make    move, it is  mandatory to use the following notation:
-  for  regular moves, the  square where  the  piece  is located
followed  by the one  where  the piece is to be  moved to (e.g.,
a1a2);
- for pawn promotion, the piece to which to promote  the pawn is
to  be written  as  one of the following characters: r, R, n, N,
b, B, q, Q (e.g., a7a8Q).  The program automatically detects the
right color to which to promote the pawn to, so the user doesn't
have to worry about using lowercase or uppercase letters.   

Note  that  castling  and  en-passant captures are automatically 
detected by the program, so they need not be specified.
